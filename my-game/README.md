# ASSIGNMENT

The task is to program a game in the form of a PWA, within which **drag and drop** technology will be used. The game will be playable on desktop as well as mobile.

The created page will also meet the following requirements:

1. The entire page will be responsive, including the graphics used (SVG is recommended). It will be possible to play the game with a mouse on desktop and by touch on mobile or tablet.
2. In addition to moving objects, it is necessary to allow their **rotation** or **changing the speed** of their movement after they are set in motion by mouse or finger movement.
   In case you decide to assemble an image, it must not be assembling from regular pieces or a classic puzzle.
3. It will be possible to play the game multiple times in a row, with the task that needs to be solved changing. It is expected to define **at least 8 different tasks/levels/problems**. Ensure random generation of tasks within a level and that they do not repeat until all have been played. An increase in difficulty levels (2-3) is also expected, which also needs to be considered during random task generation.
4. The definition of problems and their solutions will be written in the form of an **XML or JSON file**. If a new task is added to this file, the system will automatically include it among the other tasks.
5. If the user decides, for example at the third task, to interrupt playing, turn off the computer and after some time return to playing, the games they have already played will not be shown to them until they have played the remaining tasks. Then the tasks can start repeating.
6. Each task will be finishable and, where relevant, will allow displaying a hint and its solution.
7. The game will allow measuring the length of time the user needed to solve it.
8. Provide the user with information about how many times they have played the given game and what was their fastest time achieved for the given task.
9. Part of the website must be a **description of the game** and **instructions** for solving the given task. Do not forget that the game may have a part of instructions valid only for mobile.
   This part of the page must also be **optimized for printing** (do not print the game area, any menus, etc. when printing).
10. Do not forget to fine-tune the details. The game must contain a **favicon**, also it is necessary to come up with a name for the game and a game menu, so that the player can access these items and interrupt and restart the game at any time.
11. Create a **video** documenting the entire functionality of the created application.
    If any functionality is not shown in the video, we may consider it as undone.
